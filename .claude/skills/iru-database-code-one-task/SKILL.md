name: iru-database-code-one-task
description: Generate (and, when a connected database MCP allows it, execute) the queries a single database-tagged plan task calls for — grounded in the actual schema/models discovered via the `iru-explore` skill's findings (reused from earlier in the conversation if already run, or run fresh otherwise) plus whatever ticket context `iru-explore` already read. Detects the database engine in play (e.g. PostgreSQL, DB2, MongoDB, Couchbase) from the codebase/connection config, and only ever executes a generated query if it's read-only/idempotent (a `SELECT`/`find`/aggregation with no side effects) and a matching database MCP is connected — write queries (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/schema changes) are always generated but never executed, since such an MCP is expected to reject them by design. Every query, and any data returned from executing one, is shown to the user and recorded in `database-report.md` at the repository root (appended to, not overwritten, if earlier tasks in the same run already added to it) — ending with a reminder to verify its contents and a note that whether to commit it is a decision for a later step, not this skill's. Invoke as `/iru-database-code-one-task <task description>`, passing the task's own text (the operation requested, the named table(s)/collection(s)/field(s), and any sub-tasks) as the argument. Used once per task by `iru-database-code-one-task-group`, which implements a whole bucket of database tasks sequentially.

# Implement one plan task (Database)

Carry out a single database task from an `implementation_plan.md`-style task list: generate the query/queries it
calls for, execute the ones that are safe to execute, and leave a clear record of both. Unlike
`iru-java-code-one-task`/`iru-dotnet-code-one-task`, this skill's deliverable is usually not application source code —
it's the query text itself (and, where possible, real results from running it), grounded in the actual schema
rather than invented table/column names.

## Step 1 — Ground the task in the real schema and ticket context

- Reuse this conversation's own earlier `iru-explore` findings if they exist (its "Tech stack" section, and, if a
  ticket was fetched, the restated task and the specific files/classes it named) instead of re-running it. If no
  exploration has happened yet in this conversation, run it now — `Skill({skill: "iru-explore"})` (or
  `Skill({skill: "iru-explore", args: "<ticket-id>"})` if a ticket id is already known from context) — to get
  oriented before generating anything.
- From that context, plus a direct look at the actual schema-defining artifacts (migration files, ORM model/
  entity classes, `.sql` schema dumps, seed scripts, or a `docker-compose`/connection-string config naming the
  engine), determine: which database engine is in play (PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2, SQL Server, MongoDB, Couchbase,
  etc.), and the real table/collection names, column/field names, and relationships the task's queries need to
  reference. Read the actual current definitions rather than trusting the task's own wording alone — a task
  description may use a shorthand or slightly different name than the schema's real identifier.
- If the task names a table/collection/field that doesn't exist anywhere in the real schema, and the mismatch
  isn't a trivial one (singular/plural, an obvious rename), treat this as a blocker per Step 6 rather than
  inventing one.

## Step 2 — Generate the requested queries

- Write the actual query text the task calls for, in the query language matching the detected engine (that
  engine's own SQL dialect for relational databases — e.g. DB2- or PostgreSQL-specific syntax where it differs
  from generic SQL; MongoDB query/aggregation-pipeline syntax; N1QL for Couchbase), grounded in the real names
  from Step 1.
- Classify each query as either:
  - **Read-only/idempotent** — retrieves data with no side effect if run repeatedly (`SELECT`, `find`, an
    aggregation pipeline with no `$out`/`$merge` stage, etc.).
  - **Write** — could create, modify, or delete data or schema (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`MERGE`/`CREATE`/
    `ALTER`/`DROP`, `insertOne`/`updateMany`/`deleteMany`, an aggregation with `$out`/`$merge`, etc.).
- This classification is what Step 3 uses to decide whether to even attempt execution — get it right rather than
  guessing; if a query's effect is genuinely ambiguous, classify it as a write query (the safer default).

## Step 3 — Execute read-only queries via a connected database MCP, if one exists

- Search for a connected database MCP matching the detected engine (`ToolSearch` with queries like the engine's
  own name — "postgres", "postgresql", "db2", "mongodb", "couchbase" — falling back to a generic "database"/
  "sql" search if the engine name itself doesn't turn up a match).
- **No matching MCP connected**: every query from Step 2 stays generated-only. Note this plainly in the report
  (Step 4) rather than silently proceeding as if execution had been attempted.
- **A matching MCP is connected**:
  - For each **read-only/idempotent** query, execute it via the MCP tool and capture whatever it returns (rows/
    documents, or an error).
  - For each **write** query, do not attempt execution at all — these exist to be reviewed and run by a person
    (or a separate, explicitly-authorized process) through the database's own change-management path. Note in
    the report that it was generated only, and why: a write query would be rejected by the MCP's own read-only
    enforcement, and this skill does not attempt to route around that.
  - If executing a query believed to be read-only still fails (a permissions error, a genuine schema mismatch, a
    connection issue), record the failure as returned — don't retry blindly or silently reclassify the query.

## Step 4 — Write or update `database-report.md`

- If `database-report.md` already exists at the repository root (e.g. from an earlier task in the same bucket/
  run), read it and append this task's section rather than overwriting the file — `iru-database-code-one-task-group`
  calls this skill once per task, and every task's queries belong in the same report.
- For each query generated this task, add an entry naming: the task it came from, the query text (in a fenced
  code block tagged with the right language), whether it's read-only or write, and:
  - if executed: the data it returned (or the error), and
  - if not executed: why (no matching MCP connected, or it's a write query).
- Save the file.

## Step 5 — Display to the user and flag the report for review

- Show the user every query generated for this task — and, for any that were executed, the data returned —
  directly in the conversation, not just written to the file.
- State plainly that `database-report.md` was created/updated, that the user should verify its contents
  (especially any real data an executed query returned) before relying on it, and that whether the report
  should be committed is left to a later step in the run — this skill never runs `git add`/`git commit` itself.

## Step 6 — When to interrupt the user

Same bar as any other one-task skill — keep interruptions rare:

- Stop and use `AskUserQuestion` (or plain text if no real choice is being offered) only when the task is
  genuinely ambiguous in a way that changes what query gets generated (e.g. which of two similarly-named
  tables/collections it means, or a filter/aggregation the task doesn't spell out clearly enough to write), or
  when it names something that doesn't exist in the real schema per Step 1.
- Do not stop merely because a query is complex, or because it was classified as a write query that won't be
  executed — generate it and report that clearly instead (Step 7).

## Step 7 — Report the outcome

Hand control back to the caller with a short summary: how many queries were generated for this task, how many
were read-only vs. write, how many were actually executed (and against which MCP/engine) vs. skipped and why,
confirmation that `database-report.md` was updated, and whether this task stopped on a blocker per Step 6.
