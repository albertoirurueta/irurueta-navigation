description: Run this .NET/C# project or solution's Roslyn analyzers — StyleCop.Analyzers for style/formatting (the .NET equivalent of Checkstyle) and Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers' CA rules for code-quality/design/reliability/security bug detection (the .NET equivalent of PMD + SpotBugs combined) — via a clean `dotnet build` with a SARIF diagnostic log, then read the generated `.sarif` file to summarize every issue found (file, line, rule, message), grouped by tool. Invoke as `/iru-dotnet-code-quality` to check the whole solution, or `/iru-dotnet-code-quality <path-or-class-name>` to scope the summary to a specific project/file/class — the underlying build always analyzes the whole targeted solution/project (Roslyn analyzers have no per-class selector), only the reported summary is filtered. Use whenever the user wants a lint/static-analysis pass called out separately from `iru-dotnet-test`/`iru-dotnet-coverage`, instead of eyeballing raw build warnings.

# .NET Quality

Run StyleCop.Analyzers and the CA (Code Analysis) rules from Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers directly through a
build, and report every issue they find. Both are Roslyn diagnostic analyzers, so both surface through the same
build pipeline and the same SARIF log — there's no separate per-tool CLI invocation the way Checkstyle/PMD/
SpotBugs each have their own Maven goal. This skill only runs static analysis and reports results — it does not
fix issues unless asked to as a follow-up.

## Step 1 — Confirm the analyzers are actually wired up

Before running anything, check what's actually configured, since a clean report from a tool that isn't enabled
would be misleading:

- **StyleCop.Analyzers**: look for a `<PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" ... />` in the target
  project's `.csproj` or a shared `Directory.Build.props`/`Directory.Packages.props`. Note whether it's configured
  via `stylecop.json` (referenced as an `<AdditionalFiles>` item) or via `.editorconfig`
  `dotnet_diagnostic.SA####.severity` entries — either is valid.
- **CA rules (Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers)**: for SDK-style projects targeting .NET 5+, these ship
  built into the SDK and are enabled by default (`EnableNETAnalyzers` defaults to `true`); check
  `<AnalysisLevel>`/`<AnalysisMode>` in the `.csproj` (e.g. `AnalysisMode=All` enables every CA rule, not just
  the `Recommended` default subset) and `.editorconfig` `dotnet_diagnostic.CA####.severity` overrides. For
  projects targeting older frameworks, or that want a pinned analyzer version, check instead for an explicit
  `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers" ... />`.
- If neither is configured on the project(s) in scope, say so plainly in the Step 4 report instead of reporting a
  false "zero issues" — the build will simply have nothing to emit for that tool.

## Step 2 — Run a clean build with a SARIF diagnostic log

```bash
dotnet clean [<path-to-.sln-or-.csproj>]
dotnet build [<path-to-.sln-or-.csproj>] --no-incremental "-p:ErrorLog=./dotnet-code-quality.sarif%2Cversion=2"
```

- `dotnet clean` first, then `--no-incremental`, is required for the same reason `mvn clean compile` precedes
  SpotBugs: an up-to-date incremental build can skip re-analyzing unchanged files, silently leaving a stale (or
  absent) SARIF log rather than one reflecting the current source.
- `-p:ErrorLog=<path>,version=2` tells the Roslyn compiler to emit every diagnostic — compiler and analyzer alike —
  as a SARIF v2.1 log at `<path>`, regardless of whether the build itself succeeds or fails. The `%2C` escapes the
  comma so MSBuild doesn't split it into two properties; quote the whole `-p:` argument as shown.
- If the working directory (or repository root) contains a single `.sln`, `dotnet build`/`dotnet clean` target it
  by default — no need to name it explicitly, same convention as `iru-dotnet-test`. If there are multiple `.sln` files
  and no obvious default, ask which one to target unless the user already named a project/path.
- If the build fails outright due to a genuine compile error (not just an analyzer warning promoted by
  `TreatWarningsAsErrors`/`WarningsAsErrors`), the SARIF log may be incomplete or absent for the affected
  project(s) — report the compile failure and don't read a stale prior log. If the failure is purely
  warnings-as-errors from StyleCop/CA rules, the SARIF log is still written (diagnostics are captured as they're
  emitted, before that promotion fails the build) — proceed to read it normally.

## Step 3 — Read the generated SARIF log, scoped to the request if given

`./dotnet-code-quality.sarif` (or wherever `ErrorLog` pointed) can be large on a solution with many projects/
issues, and the build in Step 2 still analyzed the whole targeted solution/project regardless of scope (Roslyn
analyzers have no per-file CLI selector equivalent to Surefire's `-Dtest`) — so a scoped invocation should filter
before reading the full file rather than after.

**With no argument** (whole solution): read the file in full.

**With a specific project/file/class name**: if `jq` is available (`jq --version`), filter to just the matching
results instead of loading the whole file into context:
```bash
jq '[.runs[].results[] | select(.locations[0].physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri | endswith("/<Name>.cs"))]' \
  ./dotnet-code-quality.sarif
```
(match the named project's directory instead of a `.cs` suffix if scoping to a whole project). If `jq` isn't
available, read the full file — there's no clean line-based extraction for JSON the way `awk`'s range pattern
works for the Checkstyle/PMD skill's XML, so filtering after a full read is the fallback here, not a first
resort.

Its structure groups results by run/tool:

```json
{
  "runs": [
    {
      "tool": { "driver": { "name": "Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp", "rules": [ ... ] } },
      "results": [
        {
          "ruleId": "SA1101",
          "level": "warning",
          "message": { "text": "Prefix local calls with this" },
          "locations": [
            {
              "physicalLocation": {
                "artifactLocation": { "uri": "Services/Foo.cs" },
                "region": { "startLine": 42, "startColumn": 9 }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every project built contributes its own `run` entry, but `results` across all runs use the same `ruleId` scheme —
classify by the `ruleId` prefix, not by which `run`/`tool.driver.name` it came from:

- **`SA` (and `SX`) prefix** → StyleCop.Analyzers — style/formatting/ordering issues, the equivalent of Checkstyle
  findings.
- **`CA` prefix** → Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers — design, reliability, performance, and security rules,
  the equivalent of PMD + SpotBugs findings combined into one rule family.
- **`CS` prefix** → plain compiler warnings/errors (nullable-reference warnings, obsolete-API warnings, etc.) —
  not from either analyzer; note them separately if present, but they're out of this skill's primary scope.
- **`IDEnnnn` prefix** → built-in .NET "IDE style" analyzers driven by `.editorconfig` `dotnet_style_*`/
  `csharp_style_*` settings — also not from either named tool; note separately if present, same as `CS`.

For each `result`, record: file (`artifactLocation.uri`, relative to the project), line (`region.startLine`), rule
ID, severity (`level`: `error`/`warning`/`note`), and the message text. A `ruleId` not present in `tool.driver.
rules` for that run can still be looked up in another run's `rules` array if the same analyzer package is
referenced by multiple projects.

## Step 4 — Report

Group findings by tool (StyleCop.Analyzers, then CA rules), then by file. For each issue, give file:line, the rule
ID, severity, and the message. State a total count per tool at the top and an overall total; if a tool found zero
issues in the requested scope, say so — but if that's because the tool isn't actually configured (Step 1), say
that explicitly instead of implying a clean pass. If `CS`/`IDE` diagnostics were also present, mention them briefly
as a separate, out-of-scope bucket rather than folding them into either tool's count.

Do not attempt to fix any of the issues found, or modify project files/`.editorconfig`/`stylecop.json` — that's a
follow-up the user drives explicitly.
