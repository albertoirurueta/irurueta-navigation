description: Set up and keep current the Antora documentation site for a DDD/hexagonal Spring Boot service — bootstraps the site via `iru-setup-antora` if absent, adds the Kroki extension alongside Mermaid, and creates or refreshes the service's full page set from the codebase as it actually is: service overview, service architecture (with dependency diagrams and the reactive-versus-blocking rationale), one section per use case (flow diagram, dependencies touched, exceptions raised), the database model (entities, fields, types, indexes, mandatory fields, constraints, relationships, plus generated diagrams), REST/gRPC/GraphQL/messaging API pages derived from the contracts in `apis/` (versions, entities and fields with descriptions and constraints, deprecations, endpoints with methods/paths/headers/authorization and every documented error, and a prominent link from each API page to its own generated reference published on GitHub Pages — OpenAPI HTML from `apis/rest.adoc`, protobuf HTML from `apis/grpc.adoc`, AsyncAPI HTML from `apis/messaging.adoc`, and the SpectaQL reference plus optional Voyager schema graph from `apis/graphql.adoc` — resolved through a single `api-docs-url` attribute in `docs/antora.yml`), a configuration property table (default, dynamically-changeable, criticality flags), and a metrics table (type, tags, meaning). Reads `springboot-stack.yml`, the module sources, the `apis/` contracts, and the `@ConfigurationProperties`/Micrometer code rather than inventing content, and marks anything it cannot derive as an explicit TODO instead of filling it with plausible prose. Idempotent — safe to re-run after any change, and intended to be re-run as part of the normal change cycle. Invoke as `/iru-update-java-springboot-documentation` to cover the whole service, or `/iru-update-java-springboot-documentation <page-or-area>` to refresh one page. Use whenever a Spring Boot service's documentation needs creating or bringing back in line with its code, instead of hand-maintaining ten interdependent pages.

# Update Java Spring Boot Documentation

Create or refresh the Antora documentation for a Spring Boot service. This skill does double duty on purpose: the
first run scaffolds the page set, and every later run updates it from the code — which is the only way
documentation of this depth survives contact with an evolving service.

The governing rule: **everything on these pages is derived from something in the repository.** The contracts in
`apis/`, the `@ConfigurationProperties` classes, the Micrometer calls, the ports in `domain`, the use cases in
`application`, the persistence entities in `infrastructure/database/*`. Where something genuinely cannot be
derived — why a technology was chosen, what a use case is *for*, a business constraint — write an explicit
`TODO:` marker naming what's needed and from whom. **Never write plausible-sounding prose in place of a fact you
don't have**: a confidently wrong architecture page is worse than an obviously incomplete one, because nobody
re-checks it.

## Step 0 — Resolve scope and read the ground truth

Parse the argument: absent means every page; a page name or area (`architecture`, `use-cases`,
`database-model`, `apis/rest`, `apis/grpc`, `apis/graphql`, `apis/messaging`, `configuration`, `metrics`,
`overview`) means just that one.

Read `springboot-stack.yml` for the declared stack. Treat it as **intent**, not truth: the code is truth. Where
they disagree (a database in the manifest with no adapter module, an adapter for something the manifest doesn't
list), say so in the report — that's a real finding about the repository, not a documentation problem.

Then gather the facts, using the `Explore` agent for the broad structural sweeps rather than reading every file
into this context, and reading directly only the specific files it identifies:

| Page | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Overview | `README.md`, root pom `<description>`, the use cases in `application` |
| Architecture | the module tree, each module's pom dependencies, `stack.concurrency`, the adapters present |
| Use cases | `<base>.application.usecase.*` — the ports each one calls, the exceptions each one declares/throws |
| Database model | `infrastructure/database/*/entity/*`, the Spring Data repositories, the migration files (Mongock change units, Liquibase changelogs, Flyway scripts) — the migrations are where indexes and constraints actually live |
| REST API | `apis/rest-server/*.yaml` and the `@RestControllerAdvice` exception mapping |
| gRPC API | `apis/grpc-server/*.proto` and the gRPC exception handler |
| GraphQL API | `apis/graphql-server/*.graphqls` and the `DataFetcherExceptionResolver`, plus the `@Controller` classes — the SDL says what is exposed, the controllers say what is actually resolved |
| Messaging API | `apis/messaging/*-async-api-v*.yaml` (channels, directions, messages) and `apis/messaging/*.avsc` (payload fields), cross-checked against the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.*` configuration — the bindings are what the service actually does, the AsyncAPI file is what it claims to do |
| Configuration | every `@ConfigurationProperties` class, every `application*.yml`, and which of them carry `@RefreshScope` |
| Metrics | `infrastructure/metrics/*` — every meter name, its type, and its tag keys |

## Step 1 — Ensure the site exists, with Mermaid and Kroki

If `docs/antora.yml` is absent, invoke `iru-setup-antora` first (via the `Agent` tool with `general-purpose`, or
`Skill` directly) to get the toolchain, playbook, and ROOT module in place.

Then make sure **Kroki is wired in addition to Mermaid** — `iru-setup-antora` installs Mermaid but not Kroki, and
this page set needs both. Mermaid is right for flows, sequences, and state; Kroki adds PlantUML, C4, Graphviz, and
ERD, which is what the database-model and architecture pages need.

```bash
cd docs && npm i asciidoctor-kroki
```

In `docs/antora-playbook.yml`, add Kroki to the `asciidoc.extensions` list, keeping the existing entries:

```yaml
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    mathjax-tex-tags: ams
    mathjax-tex-packages: ams
    # Fetch diagrams at build time and commit nothing generated; images end up in the built site.
    kroki-fetch-diagram: true
    # Default is the public https://kroki.io. Point at a self-hosted instance if the source must not
    # leave the network — diagram source is sent to whichever server this names.
    kroki-server-url: https://kroki.io
  extensions:
    - '@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax'
    - asciidoctor-kroki
```

Flag in the report that with the public Kroki server, **every diagram's source text is sent to a third-party
service at build time**. For a service whose architecture or database model is sensitive, self-host Kroki (a single
container) and change `kroki-server-url`. This is a genuine consideration, not boilerplate — the database model
page describes the data layout of a real system.

Verify both work by building the site in Step 12; a Kroki block with the extension missing silently renders as a
literal code block rather than failing, which is easy to miss.

Also add the `api-docs-url` attribute to **`docs/antora.yml`** (the component descriptor, not the playbook — the
playbook block above is for build-time extension settings, while this is a content attribute the pages
reference). Steps 7–9 all link to their generated reference through it:

```yaml
# docs/antora.yml — alongside name/version/title/nav
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    api-docs-url: 'https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/api'
```

Step 7 explains how to resolve the value and what each link path is. If the repository has no `apis/` directory at
all, skip the attribute — there are no API pages to link from.

## Step 2 — Page set and navigation

Create under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/`, and add each to `nav.adoc` preserving existing entries:

```
index.adoc                    (service overview)
architecture.adoc
use-cases.adoc
database-model.adoc
apis/rest.adoc
apis/grpc.adoc
apis/graphql.adoc
apis/messaging.adoc
configuration.adoc
metrics.adoc
```

Omit a page whose subject doesn't exist (no gRPC server → no `apis/grpc.adoc`); note the omission in the report so
its absence is a recorded decision.

Every page carries this immediately after its `= Title` heading, matching the rest of this catalog:

```
NOTE: This documentation was generated with the assistance of AI. Please report any inaccuracies.
```

On a re-run, **update pages rather than rewriting them**: preserve hand-written prose (especially the "why"
sections that only a human can supply) and refresh the derived parts — tables, diagrams, endpoint lists, property
lists. If a hand-written statement now contradicts the code, don't silently overwrite it: update it and list the
contradiction in the report, since it may mean the code changed without the intent changing.

## Step 3 — `index.adoc` — service overview

What the service is for and what it offers. Short — a page someone reads in a minute:

- One paragraph on purpose, in domain terms.
- What it offers: the capabilities, as a list, derived from the use cases and the API contracts.
- What it depends on, at one line each.
- Where to go next: links to the other pages, plus the generated API references on GitHub Pages — the same
  `{api-docs-url}/...` links Steps 7–9 use, gathered here so the overview is a working index of everything the
  service publishes.

Mark `TODO:` for the business purpose if `README.md` and the pom description don't state it — that's a question
for the service's owner, not something to infer from class names.

## Step 4 — `architecture.adoc` — technical architecture

The deepest page, and the one with the highest chance of drifting into invention. Discipline: state what the code
does, and mark the rationale `TODO:` unless it's recorded somewhere.

- **Hexagonal structure** — the module table, what each module may depend on, and the two mechanisms that enforce
  it (the `banned-dependencies` enforcer rules and the ArchUnit test). Name the test class so a reader can go look.
- **Concurrency model** — reactive, blocking, or both, taken from the actual starters in the poms. Explain the
  consequence (blocking with virtual threads enabled, or a Netty event loop that must never be blocked). The
  *reason* for the choice is a `TODO:` unless recorded.
- **Per-technology sections** — one each for the databases, cache, Kafka, and clients present. For each: what it
  is used for in this service, which module adapts it, which ports it implements. Include the "why this
  technology" guidance the stack manifest recorded if it's there; otherwise `TODO:`. For each downstream client,
  also name the contract it is generated from (`apis/rest-client/<name>/` or `apis/grpc-client/<name>/`) and the
  fact that the same contract drives the API mock (`stack.apiMock` — Microcks or WireMock) that stands in for that
  service in integration tests and local runs, so a reader knows where to add a response rather than inventing a
  fixture.
- **Dependency diagram** — a Mermaid `flowchart` of the service and its external dependencies (each database,
  cache, Kafka topic direction, and downstream service via REST/gRPC), generated from the modules and bindings
  actually present:

  ````
  [mermaid]
  ....
  flowchart LR
    subgraph service["<service-name>"]
      api["api/*"] --> app["application"]
      app --> domain["domain"]
      infra["infrastructure/*"] -.implements ports.-> domain
    end
    infra --> mongo[(MongoDB)]
    infra --> redis[(Redis)]
    infra -- produces --> topicOut{{orders.events.v1}}
    topicIn{{payments.events.v1}} -- consumed by --> api
    infra --> payments["payments service (REST)"]
  ....
  ````

- **Module dependency diagram** — a Kroki C4 or PlantUML component diagram of the internal module graph, which
  reads better than Mermaid for the ports-and-adapters shape:

  ````
  [plantuml,module-dependencies,svg]
  ....
  @startuml
  ...
  @enduml
  ....
  ````

- **Cross-cutting concerns** — the dynamic-configuration mechanism, how secrets reach the service, the graceful
  shutdown behaviour, and the health probes. Each is a fact readable from the configuration files.

## Step 5 — `use-cases.adoc`

One section per class in `<base>.application.usecase`. For each, derived from the code:

- **What it does**, from the class/method Javadoc. If there is none, `TODO:` — and note in the report that the use
  case is undocumented in code, which is worth fixing at the source.
- **Trigger** — which REST endpoint, gRPC method, or Kafka topic reaches it (trace inbound from the
  controllers/services/consumers).
- **Steps** — the ordered calls it makes, as a numbered list.
- **Dependencies** — every port it uses, and which adapter (hence which database, client, or topic) backs each.
- **Exceptions** — every exception it can raise, why, and what the caller sees (the HTTP status or gRPC code from
  the exception-mapping advice).
- **A Mermaid sequence diagram** of the flow, including the failure branch — a happy-path-only diagram hides the
  half of the behaviour that matters during an incident:

  ````
  [mermaid]
  ....
  sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant R as RestController
    participant U as PlaceOrderUseCase
    participant P as OrderRepository (port)
    participant A as MongoOrderAdapter
    C->>R: POST /v1/orders
    R->>U: placeOrder(command)
    U->>P: save(order)
    P->>A: save(entity)
    A-->>U: Order
    U-->>R: OrderId
    R-->>C: 201 Created
    Note over U,P: On conflict, ConflictException → 409
  ....
  ````

## Step 6 — `database-model.adoc`

One section per database engine. Read the entity classes **and** the migration files — indexes and constraints are
usually declared in the migration, not the entity, so an entity-only read produces a model page that's missing
exactly the information an operator needs.

Per collection/table/node label:

- What it holds and why it exists.
- A field table: **name, type, mandatory, indexed, constraints (length, pattern, range, enum values), default,
  description**. Every column filled or explicitly `TODO:`.
- Which indexes exist, on which fields, whether unique, and — where derivable from the repository query methods —
  which query each index serves. An index nobody can attribute to a query is worth flagging.
- For relational models: the relationships (cardinality, FK constraints, cascade behaviour).
- For Neo4j: node labels, relationship types and directions, and their properties.

Then a diagram per engine — Kroki's ERD/PlantUML for relational, a Mermaid `erDiagram` for document stores
(showing references between documents even where the database doesn't enforce them, since the *application* does),
and a graph diagram for Neo4j.

Note the migration tool in use and where its changelogs live, so a reader knows how a model change is made.

## Step 7 — `apis/rest.adoc`

### Linking to the generated reference — applies to Steps 7, 8, 8a and 9 alike

**Every API page must link to its generated reference, and each page links to its own.** The REST page links to
the OpenAPI HTML, the gRPC page to the protobuf HTML, the messaging page to the AsyncAPI HTML. These are the
pages `iru-setup-java-springboot-apis` generates into `target/generated-docs/` and the build workflow publishes to
GitHub Pages next to this site. Without the link, the two halves of the API documentation — the prose that explains
and the reference that enumerates — sit on the same site with nothing connecting them, and the reader who needs the
exhaustive field list never finds it.

Put the link **near the top of the page**, right after the intro and before the version summary, not buried at the
bottom: someone opening `apis/rest.adoc` to integrate against the service wants the reference in the first screen.

The generated HTML is **not Antora content**, so `xref:` cannot reach it — an `xref:` to it fails the build or
silently resolves to nothing. It has to be a URL. Define the base once as an attribute in `docs/antora.yml` so all
three pages share it and a domain change is a single edit:

```yaml
# docs/antora.yml
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    api-docs-url: 'https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/api'
```

Resolve that value rather than guessing it:

- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages --jq .html_url` is authoritative when Pages is already configured — it
  accounts for a custom domain, which a URL derived from the remote won't.
- Otherwise derive `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>` from `git remote get-url origin`, and check for a `CNAME`
  file in the published output or a configured custom domain before settling on it.
- If GitHub Pages isn't set up yet, still write the attribute with the derived URL, and say in the report that the
  links stay dead until Pages is enabled and the build workflow has run once on the main branch.

Then link per contract version — `v1` and `v2` each get their own line, since each generates its own page:

```adoc
{api-docs-url}/rest-server/v1/index.html[OpenAPI v1 reference^]
{api-docs-url}/grpc-server/v1/index.html[Protobuf v1 reference^]
{api-docs-url}/messaging/v1/index.html[AsyncAPI v1 reference^]
```

GraphQL publishes **two** references rather than one, because `graphql-codegen-maven-plugin` generates code and the
documentation comes from a separate npm toolchain (`iru-setup-java-springboot-apis` Step 3b):

```adoc
{api-docs-url}/graphql-server/v1/index.html[GraphQL v1 reference^]
{api-docs-url}/graphql-server/v1/voyager/index.html[GraphQL v1 schema graph^]
```

The Voyager graph is optional, so **check `apis/graphql-server/docs/package.json` for `graphql-voyager` before
linking it** — a link to a page that was never generated is worse than no link. If the whole GraphQL documentation
toolchain is absent, link the SDL in the repository instead and name SpectaQL in the report as the way to add a
reference; don't invent the URL either way.

Whatever the toolchain, also say where a reader can reach the **live** schema if the service enables
`spring.graphql.schema.printer.enabled` or the GraphiQL endpoint (`spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled`), noting that
those are normally on in `local`/`dev` profiles only.

The trailing `^` opens the reference in a new tab, so the reader doesn't lose their place in the prose.

**Confirm those paths against the repository rather than copying them.** They must match two things that can drift:
the `output`/`-o` directories configured in the module poms' documentation executions, and the `Merge documentation`
step in `.github/workflows/build.yml` that decides where under `doc/api/` each one lands. If the workflow publishes
somewhere else, the workflow wins — fix the link, and note the discrepancy in the report.

Alongside each generated-reference link, link the **source contract** in the repository too (a `blob` URL to
`apis/rest-server/<spec>.yaml`, `apis/grpc-server/<file>.proto`, or `apis/messaging/<file>.yaml`). The generated
page is the readable form; the contract is the authoritative one, and a reader filing a bug needs to point at it.

One caveat that the build will not catch for you: if `api-docs-url` is undefined, Antora logs
`skipping reference to missing attribute: api-docs-url`, leaves the literal `{api-docs-url}/...[...]` text in the
rendered page, and **still exits 0**. Step 12 checks for exactly this.

### Page content

Derived from every spec in `apis/rest-server/`, one section per version:

- **Version summary** — what functionality each version provides, and the status of each (current, deprecated,
  planned removal). This is the table someone consults before integrating.
- **Entities** — per schema: what it represents, then a field table with **description, type, mandatory,
  deprecated (with reason), constraints** (`maxLength`, `pattern`, `minimum`, `format`).
- **Endpoints** — per operation:
  - HTTP method and full path, path parameters marked;
  - required request headers;
  - whether authorization is required and of what kind (Basic, Bearer/JWT, or a named OAuth2 flow with the
    required scopes) — read this from the spec's `securitySchemes` **and** cross-check it against the
    `SecurityFilterChain` rules in `api/rest-server`. If the two disagree, that's a security finding: report it
    rather than documenting one of them;
  - request and response bodies with their schema references;
  - **every error response**: HTTP status, the error body schema, and what causes it. Cross-check against the
    `@RestControllerAdvice` mapping so an exception the code can throw but the spec doesn't document shows up as a
    gap.
- The generated-reference and contract links described above: one
  `{api-docs-url}/rest-server/<version>/index.html[OpenAPI <version> reference^]` per spec in `apis/rest-server/`,
  plus a link to each spec file in the repository. Don't duplicate the whole reference here — this page explains,
  the generated docs enumerate.

## Step 8 — `apis/grpc.adoc`

Same shape, from `apis/grpc-server/*.proto`:

- Version summary per `package <service>.vN`.
- **Messages and enums** — per type, and per field: description, type, mandatory, deprecated (with reason),
  constraints. Note that protobuf has no native optionality for `proto3` scalars beyond `optional`, so state which
  fields are semantically required and enforced in code.
- **RPCs** — per method: whether it's unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, or bidirectional **and why**
  (streaming is a design decision worth a sentence); the full path (`/<package>.<Service>/<Method>`); required
  metadata/headers; whether authorization is required and how (typically a JWT in the `authorization` metadata
  key); and every error: gRPC `Status.Code`, the error detail payload, and its cause — cross-checked against the
  gRPC exception handler.
- The generated-reference and contract links, per the shared rules in Step 7: one
  `{api-docs-url}/grpc-server/<version>/index.html[Protobuf <version> reference^]` per `package <service>.vN`, plus
  a link to each `.proto` file in the repository. This is the `protoc-gen-doc` output — if Step 3's survey of
  `apis/grpc-server`'s pom shows the documentation execution fell back to a `docker run pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc`
  step, or isn't wired at all, say so on the page instead of linking to a reference that was never generated.
- The field-numbering and `reserved` discipline, so a reader knows how to evolve the contract safely.

## Step 8a — `apis/graphql.adoc`

From `apis/graphql-server/*.graphqls`, cross-checked against the `@Controller` classes in `api/graphql-server` and
the `spring.graphql.*` configuration. The page must cover three things: the **data models**, the **operations**, and
the **endpoints** they are reached through.

- **Endpoints** — the section a REST-trained reader most needs, because there is normally exactly one. State the
  HTTP endpoint (`spring.graphql.path`, default `/graphql`) and that every query and mutation is a `POST` to it;
  the WebSocket path for subscriptions (`spring.graphql.websocket.path`) if any `Subscription` field exists, or say
  plainly that subscriptions aren't served; the GraphiQL explorer path (`spring.graphql.graphiql.path`, default
  `/graphiql`) **and in which profiles it is enabled**, since leaving it on in production exposes the whole schema;
  the SSE/multipart path if configured; and the authentication expected on each. Read every one of these from the
  `application*.yml` files rather than quoting the defaults — a service that moved its path and a page that says
  `/graphql` is worse than no page.
- **Version summary** per SDL file, following the same convention as the other pages. Note that GraphQL carries no
  version in the request, so which schema a client gets is decided by the endpoint it calls — say explicitly how
  versions are separated here (separate endpoints, or a single evolving schema with deprecations).
- **Data models** — per `type`, `input`, `interface`, `union` and `enum`: what it represents, then a field table with
  **description, type, nullable, deprecated (with the `@deprecated` reason), and arguments**. GraphQL's `!` is the
  non-null marker: read it as the mandatory column rather than inventing one.
- **Operations** — per `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription` field: what it does, its arguments and their
  constraints, what it returns, whether authorization is required and of what kind, and which use case backs it.
  Cross-check every field against the controllers: **a field in the SDL that no `@Controller` method resolves is a
  finding**, not a documentation gap — it returns `null` at runtime. (`spring.graphql.schema.inspection` reports
  exactly this at startup; say whether it's enabled.)
- **Errors** — GraphQL answers `200 OK` with an `errors` array, so document the `extensions.classification` values
  the `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` produces and what causes each. A reader who expects HTTP status codes will
  otherwise assume every response succeeded.
- **Limits** — the configured query depth and complexity limits, and the paginated fields, since those are what a
  client must design its queries around. If no limits are configured, say so plainly: it's an availability risk,
  not a blank cell.
- The generated-reference links described in Step 7: the SpectaQL reference, the Voyager schema graph if it was
  generated, the SDL in the repository, and the live-schema pointer where one exists.

## Step 9 — `apis/messaging.adoc`

From the AsyncAPI specification (`apis/messaging/*-async-api-v*.yaml`), the AVRO schemas
(`apis/messaging/*.avsc`), and the Spring Cloud Stream bindings. The AsyncAPI file already states the topics,
directions, and messages, so most of this page is a transcription of it — but it is a hand-written contract, so
**verify it against the bindings rather than trusting it**, and report any channel it declares that no binding
implements (or vice versa) as a finding about the repository.

Note when reading it that an AsyncAPI 3 operation's `action` is written from this service's point of view — `send`
is a message it produces, `receive` one it consumes — and that the topic name is the channel's `address`, not the
channel key. If the document is an older 2.x one, its `publish`/`subscribe` mean the *opposite* of the intuitive
reading (`subscribe` is what the service sends); documenting the arrows backwards is the easiest mistake to make on
this page.

- **Topic summary** — every topic the service produces to or consumes from, its purpose, direction, the consumer
  group used, and the DLQ topic if configured. Topic names come from the bindings configuration and should match
  the AsyncAPI channel keys; say so if they don't.
- **Version summary per topic** — what each schema version provides, and which are still in flight.
- **Messages** — per AVRO record: what event it represents and when it's emitted; then per field: description,
  type, mandatory (a field with no default is mandatory), deprecated (with reason), constraints, and its default.
- The registry's compatibility mode and the subject naming strategy in use, since those determine what schema
  change is legal.
- Which use case produces or consumes each message, linking to `use-cases.adoc`.
- The generated-reference and contract links, per the shared rules in Step 7: one
  `{api-docs-url}/messaging/<version>/index.html[AsyncAPI <version> reference^]` per
  `apis/messaging/*-async-api-v*.yaml`, plus a link to each AsyncAPI file and to the `.avsc` schemas it references.
  Both parts matter here: the generated page renders the AVRO payloads inline (the AsyncAPI document `$ref`s the
  `.avsc` files), so it is the only place a reader sees topics and payload fields together.

As with the REST and gRPC pages, don't restate what the generated HTML already shows well. What justifies this
page is everything the generator can't know: consumer groups, DLQ topics, which use case produces or consumes each
message, and the registry's compatibility mode.

## Step 10 — `configuration.adoc`

The table whose purpose is to answer "what can we change about this service's behaviour without a code change?" —
so it must be complete for the service's own properties.

Columns: **Property | Description | Type | Default | Dynamically changeable | Critical | Notes**

- **Only the service's own properties** (the `@ConfigurationProperties` prefixes from
  `infrastructure/configuration`, and any other project-specific key in `application*.yml`). A Spring Boot
  property goes in only when it's genuinely important to operating *this* service (e.g.
  `spring.threads.virtual.enabled`, a connection-pool size that has been tuned, a Kafka consumer concurrency) —
  mark such rows so it's clear they're framework properties, not the service's own.
- **Default** — the actual default from the code or the YAML, not a guess. If a property has no default and must
  be supplied, say "required" rather than leaving it blank.
- **Dynamically changeable** — Yes only where the bean is genuinely `@RefreshScope`d *and* the configured dynamic
  mechanism can deliver the change. "Restart required" and "Redeploy required" are the other two values.
  Getting this column wrong is actively harmful during an incident, so derive it from the annotations, never
  from intent.
- **Critical** — flag (e.g. `⚠`) the properties that are performance or availability levers: timeouts, retry
  counts, pool sizes, batch sizes, circuit-breaker thresholds, feature toggles that shed load, cache TTLs. The
  purpose of the flag is that during a degradation someone can scan this column for the fastest temporary
  mitigation. Add a short sentence per flagged row saying which symptom it addresses and in which direction to
  move it.
- **A legend** below the table explaining the flag, the "dynamically changeable" values, and the framework-property
  marker.
- Never put a real credential, endpoint, or token in an example value — reference the environment variable or
  secret name instead.

## Step 11 — `metrics.adoc`

Columns: **Metric | Description | Type | Tags (and possible values) | Notes**

- Every meter the service publishes from `infrastructure/metrics`, plus any notable framework meter the team
  actually watches (marked as framework-provided).
- **Type** — counter, gauge, timer, distribution summary, long task timer — read from the Micrometer call.
- **Tags** — every tag key and its possible values. Where a tag's values come from an enum, list them; where they
  can't be enumerated, say so and flag the cardinality risk, because that's the field that takes down a metrics
  backend.
- **Notes** — what a change in this metric indicates, and whether it backs an alert or a dashboard panel.
- Add a short section on where metrics are scraped from (`/actuator/prometheus` on the management port) and how to
  view them locally (the compose `observability` profile → Prometheus on 9090, Grafana on 3000).

## Step 12 — Build and verify

```bash
cd docs && npx antora antora-playbook.yml
```

Fix every error and every warning that indicates a real problem: a broken `xref:`, a malformed AsciiDoc table (the
most common failure with tables this wide), invalid Mermaid or PlantUML syntax, a missing nav entry.

Then verify what the build won't catch:

- **Every Mermaid and Kroki diagram actually rendered** — open the built HTML and check. A Kroki block with a
  syntax error, or with the extension unregistered, renders as a literal code block without failing the build.
- **Each of `apis/rest.adoc`, `apis/grpc.adoc` and `apis/messaging.adoc` that exists carries its generated-reference
  link, and the link resolved.** Two distinct checks, because neither fails the build:
  - Grep the build log for `skipping reference to missing attribute: api-docs-url`. Antora logs that warning,
    leaves the literal `{api-docs-url}/...` text in the page, and still exits 0 — so the page looks finished and
    ships a visibly broken link.
  - Grep the built HTML (`docs/build/site/**/apis/*.html`) for the expected `href` on each page. An `<a href>`
    containing `{api-docs-url}` means the attribute never resolved; no matching `<a>` at all means the link was
    never written.
- The link targets match where the build workflow actually publishes (`doc/api/rest-server/…`,
  `doc/api/grpc-server/…`, `doc/api/messaging/…`), cross-checked against `.github/workflows/build.yml` rather than
  assumed. If Pages has already published at least once, fetching one of the URLs is the definitive check; a 404
  before the first main-branch build is expected, not a defect.
- No page contains an invented fact where a `TODO:` belongs. Re-read the architecture and use-case pages
  specifically with that question in mind — they're where invention creeps in.

## Step 13 — Report

Summarize:

- Pages created, pages updated, pages omitted (and why).
- Whether Kroki had to be installed and the playbook amended.
- The `api-docs-url` value resolved, how it was resolved (the Pages API, the git remote, or a custom domain), and
  the generated-reference link written on each API page. Call out explicitly any API page whose reference isn't
  generated at all — a gRPC documentation execution that was never wired, or messaging documentation missing
  because the AsyncAPI step was skipped — and whether GitHub Pages has published yet, since until it has, every one
  of these links 404s.
- **Every `TODO:` written, grouped by page**, so the user has a concrete list of what only a human can supply. This
  is the most useful part of the report — present it as a list, not a count.
- **Every discrepancy found between the code and the manifest, the spec and the security configuration, or the
  spec and the exception mapping.** These are findings about the service, not about the documentation: an
  undocumented error response, an endpoint whose spec security doesn't match its filter chain, a property that
  looks dynamic but isn't `@RefreshScope`d, a metric with unbounded tag cardinality, an index no query uses.
- Whether hand-written prose was preserved or contradicted on a re-run.
- The build result and the path to `docs/build/site/index.html`.

Warn explicitly:

- **Review the derived content before trusting it**, particularly the architecture rationale and the use-case
  descriptions — those are the pages where a plausible sentence can be wrong.
- **The configuration table's "dynamically changeable" and "critical" columns get used under pressure.** If either
  is wrong, someone will make an incident worse by acting on it. Verify them.
- With the public Kroki server, diagram source leaves the network at build time; self-host if the model is
  sensitive.
- Re-run this skill after any change to a contract, an entity, a configuration property, a metric, or a use case —
  the pages are derived, so they go stale the moment the code moves.
