     *          [0  sy  0 ]
     *          [0  0   sz]

     * <pre>
     *     Ta = [1          -alphaXy    alphaXz ]
     *          [alphaYx    1           -alphaYz]
     *          [-alphaZx   alphaZy     1       ]
     * </pre>

     * <pre>
     *     Ma = [sx    mxy  mxz] = Ta*Ka =  [sx             -sy * alphaXy   sz * alphaXz ]

     *          [mzx   mzy  sz ]            [-sx * alphaZx  sy * alphaZy    sz           ]
     * </pre>
     * This instance allows any 3x3 matrix however, typically alphaYx, alphaZx and alphaZy
     * are considered to be zero if the accelerometer z-axis is assumed to be the same
     * as the body z-axis. When this is assumed, myx = mzx = mzy = 0 and the Ma matrix
     * becomes upper diagonal:
     * <pre>
     *     Ma = [sx    mxy  mxz]
     *          [0     sy   myz]
     *          [0     0    sz ]
     * </pre>
     * Values of this matrix are unitless.
     *
     * @return estimated accelerometer scale factors and cross coupling errors, or null
     * if not available.
