     *          [0  0   sz]

     *          [-alphaZx   alphaZy     1       ]

     * <pre>

     * </pre>
     * This instance allows any 3x3 matrix however, typically alphaYx, alphaZx and alphaZy
     * are considered to be zero if the gyroscope z-axis is assumed to be the same
     * as the body z-axis. When this is assumed, myx = mzx = mzy = 0 and the Mg matrix
     * becomes upper diagonal:
     * <pre>
     *     Mg = [sx    mxy  mxz]
     *          [0     sy   myz]
     *          [0     0    sz ]
     * </pre>
     * Values of this matrix are unitless.
     *
     * @return estimated gyroscope scale factors and cross coupling errors.
