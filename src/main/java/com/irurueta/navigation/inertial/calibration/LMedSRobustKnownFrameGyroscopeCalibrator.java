/**
 * Robustly estimates gyroscope biases, cross couplings and scaling factors
 * along with G-dependent cross biases introduced on the gyroscope by the
 * specific forces sensed by the accelerometer using an LMedS algorithm to discard
 * outliers.
 * <p>
 * To use this calibrator at least 7 measurements at different known frames must
 * be provided. In other words, accelerometer and gyroscope (i.e. body kinematics)
 * samples must be obtained at 7 different positions, orientations and velocities
 * (although typically velocities are always zero).
 * <p>
 * Measured gyroscope angular rates is assumed to follow the model shown below:
 * <pre>
 *     立meas = bg + (I + Mg) * 立true + Gg * ftrue + w
 * </pre>
 * Where:
 * - 立meas is the measured gyroscope angular rates. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - bg is the gyroscope bias. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a
 * 3x1 zero vector.
 * - I is the 3x3 identity matrix.
 * - Mg is the 3x3 matrix containing cross-couplings and scaling factors. Ideally, on
 * a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3 zero matrix.
 * - 立true is ground-truth gyroscope angular rates.
 * - Gg is the G-dependent cross biases introduced by the specific forces sensed
 * by the accelerometer. Ideally, on a perfect gyroscope, this should be a 3x3
 * zero matrix.
 * - ftrue is ground-truth specific force. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - w is measurement noise. This is a 3x1 vector.
