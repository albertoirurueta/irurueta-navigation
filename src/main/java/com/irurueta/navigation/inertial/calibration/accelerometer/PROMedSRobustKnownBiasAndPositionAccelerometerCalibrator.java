 * Robustly estimates accelerometer cross couplings and scaling factors

 * <p>
 * To use this calibrator at least 10 measurements taken at a single known position must
 * be taken at 10 different unknown orientations and zero velocity when common z-axis
 * is assumed, otherwise at least 13 measurements are required.
 * <p>
 * Measured specific force is assumed to follow the model shown below:
 * <pre>
 *     fmeas = ba + (I + Ma) * ftrue + w
 * </pre>
 * Where:
 * - fmeas is the measured specific force. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - ba is accelerometer bias. Ideally, on a perfect accelerometer, this should be a
 * 3x1 zero vector.
 * - I is the 3x3 identity matrix.
 * - Ma is the 3x3 matrix containing cross-couplings and scaling factors. Ideally, on
 * a perfect accelerometer, this should be a 3x3 zero matrix.
 * - ftrue is ground-trush specific force.
 * - w is measurement noise.
