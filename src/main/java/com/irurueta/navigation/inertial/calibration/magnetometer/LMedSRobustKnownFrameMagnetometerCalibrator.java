/**
 * Robustly estimates magnetometer hard-iron biases, soft-iron cross
 * couplings and scaling factors using LMedS algorithm.
 * <p>
 * To use this calibrator at least 4 measurements at different known
 * frames must be provided. In other words, magnetometer samples must
 * be obtained at 4 different positions or orientations.
 * Notice that frame velocities are ignored by this calibrator.
 * <p>
 * Measured magnetic flux density is assumed to follow the model shown below:
 * <pre>
 *     mBmeas = bm + (I + Mm) * mBtrue + w
 * </pre>
 * Where:
 * - mBmeas is the measured magnetic flux density. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - bm is magnetometer hard-iron bias. Ideally, on a perfect magnetometer,
 * this should be a 3x1 zero vector.
 * - I is the 3x3 identity matrix.
 * - Mm is the 3x3 soft-iron matrix containing cross-couplings and scaling
 * factors. Ideally, on a perfect magnetometer, this should be a 3x3 zero
 * matrix.
 * - mBtrue is ground-truth magnetic flux density. This is a 3x1 vector.
 * - w is measurement noise. This is a 3x1 vector.
